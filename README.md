# Examination_System
This project is an exam system designed to facilitate online exams for students and question management for doctors. The system supports two main actors: "Student" and "doctors".
Features
1) Student Interface: Students can use the system to take exams and view their scores.
2) Admin Interface: Admins can create questions related to various subjects and monitor exams.
3) Randomized Exams: When a student enters an exam, the system generates the exam randomly from the pool of questions created by admins.
4) Answer Validation: The system validates student answers and calculates the exam score.
